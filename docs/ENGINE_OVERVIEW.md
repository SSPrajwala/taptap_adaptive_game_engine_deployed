TapTap Adaptive Modular Game Engine (TAMGE)
1. Engine Vision

The TapTap Adaptive Modular Game Engine (TAMGE) is designed to transform static learning games into intelligent, scalable, and reusable systems.

Instead of building one-time games, TAMGE provides a universal execution layer that dynamically loads and runs multiple game types using configuration-driven architecture.

The goal is to:

Gamify learning effectively

Improve employability skills through adaptive challenges

Enable large-scale deployment across campuses

Support future expansion without rewriting core logic

2. Core Design Principles

The engine is built on the following principles:

Modular Architecture – Clear separation of concerns

Configuration-Driven Design – Games defined via JSON

Adaptive Intelligence – Performance-based difficulty progression

Scalability-First Approach – Cloud-ready and stateless design

Reusability – Plug-and-play game integration

Maintainability – Clean and extensible structure

3. Engine Core Modules
Game Loader

Responsible for dynamically loading and validating game configuration files (JSON). It ensures the engine runs independently of specific game content.

Level Manager

Controls stage transitions, manages progression rules, and coordinates between gameplay states.

Adaptive Engine

Evaluates player performance metrics and dynamically adjusts difficulty levels based on predefined thresholds.

Score Engine

Calculates final scores using accuracy, response time, and attempt count. Supports customizable scoring rules per game.

Timer Engine

Manages level-based and global timers with configurable duration per difficulty stage.

Leaderboard Interface

Communicates player performance data to backend services for ranking and analytics.

4. Adaptive Intelligence Model

The Adaptive Engine introduces performance-driven branching logic.

Decision thresholds:

Accuracy > 80% → Skip to higher difficulty

Accuracy < 50% → Repeat level

Otherwise → Progress normally

Performance parameters considered:

Accuracy percentage

Response time

Attempt frequency

This system ensures personalized progression, optimized challenge levels, and improved engagement.

5. Reusability Strategy

TAMGE is fully configuration-driven.

Each game is defined by a JSON schema containing:

Level structure

Question datasets

Timer configuration

Scoring rules

Difficulty mapping

To deploy a new game:

Define game-config.json

Register the game type

Deploy without modifying engine core

This ensures rapid game creation and zero duplication of logic.

6. Scalability Model

The architecture supports large-scale deployment across campuses.

Stateless backend services

MongoDB Atlas cloud database

Modular frontend engine layer

API-driven leaderboard integration

The system is designed to support thousands of concurrent users without architectural modification.

7. Future Enhancements

The engine is built to support future intelligence upgrades:

AI-based difficulty prediction

Skill analytics dashboard

Campus-level leaderboard clustering

Real-time multiplayer integration

Behavioral performance analytics

TAMGE is not just a hackathon prototype — it is a scalable foundation for a gamified learning ecosystem.
